Task : 2 - Movie Rating Prediction - Here, I built a machine learning model for Movie Rating Prediction for the IMDB dataset from the Kaggle. In this project, I have implemented Linear Regression technique for the prediction. Firstly we have proceesed the data and visualized it with multiple chart for analysis then made feature engineering to make the data ready for model. Finally we have rated our model performance with evaluation metrics.
